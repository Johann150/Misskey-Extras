## Post Replies on Hover

* **Author**: Volpeon
* **Date**: 2021-09-25
* **Misskey Version**: 12.91.0
* **Description**: A custom CSS snippet to declutter the timeline, similar to
how Pleroma displays replies.

- Parent posts are hidden by default
- When you hover a post, the parent post will be shown
- To avoid any erratic behavior, the parent post appears on top of the preceding post, covering it
- For better visibility, the hovered post will be highlighted

## MFM on Hover

* **Author**: Fristi, Volpeon, Robflop
* **Date**: 2021-08-23
* **Misskey Version**: 12.89.0
* **Description**: A custom CSS snippet which stops MFM animations until you
are hovering over the post. This makes it much less annoying to browse your
timeline if someone has made a post with MFM that causes the post's contents
to go outside of the post itself.

## Post Replies slide out

* **Author**: Johann150
* **Date**: 2021-08-23
* **Misskey Version**: at least since 12.83.4
* **Description**: Alternate way to collapse parent posts that does not allow
overflow.

- Parent posts are shortened to the user name and first line of content.
- When you hover over the parent post, the main post will slide down to make
  the rest of the parent post visible.
